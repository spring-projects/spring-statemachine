This module is using bower to manage its javascript dependencies
but it is not yet integrated into a gradle build process. Thus all
javascript dependencies are already included in
`src/main/resources/static/lib`.

Usual process to create javascript deps is to run(for ubuntu):

[indent=0]
----
sudo apt-get install nodejs
sudo apt-get install npm
sudo sudo npm install bower
----

and then run from this directory:
[indent=0]
----
bower install
----

which is using `bower.json` to update dependencies.
