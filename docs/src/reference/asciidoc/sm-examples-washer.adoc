== Washer

The washer sample demonstrates how to use a history state to recover a
running state configuration with a simulated power-off situation.

Anyone who has ever used a washing machine knows that if you somehow pause
the program, it continue from the same state when unpaused.
You can implement this kind of behavior in a state machine by using
a history pseudo state.
The following image shows our state machine for a washer:

The following listing shows the enumeration that defines the possible states:

====
.States
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/demo/washer/Application.java[tags=snippetB]

The following listing shows the enumeration that defines the events:

====
.Events
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/demo/washer/Application.java[tags=snippetC]

The following listing configures the possible states:

====
.Configuration - states
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/demo/washer/Application.java[tags=snippetAA]

The following listing configures the possible transitions:

.Configuration - transitions

The following example shows how this state machine actually works:

====
[source,text]
----
sm>start
Entry state RUNNING
Entry state WASHING
State machine started

sm>event RINSE
Exit state WASHING
Entry state RINSING
Event RINSE send

sm>event DRY
Exit state RINSING
Entry state DRYING
Event DRY send

sm>event CUTPOWER
Exit state DRYING
Exit state RUNNING
Entry state POWEROFF
Event CUTPOWER send

sm>event RESTOREPOWER
Exit state POWEROFF
Entry state RUNNING
Entry state WASHING
Entry state DRYING
Event RESTOREPOWER send
----
====

In the preceding run:

* The state machine is started, which causes machine to get initialized.
* The state machine goes to RINSING state.
* The state machine goes to DRYING state.
* The state machine cuts power and goes to POWEROFF state.
* The state is restored from the HISTORY state, which takes state machine back
  to its previous known state.
