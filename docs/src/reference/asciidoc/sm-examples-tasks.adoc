== Tasks

The Tasks sample demonstrates parallel task handling within
regions and adds error handling to either
automatically or manually fix task problems before continuing back
to a state where the tasks can be run again.
The following image shows the Tasks state machine:

On a high level, in this state machine:

* We always try to get into the `READY` state so that we can use the
  RUN event to execute tasks.
* The `TASKS` state, which is composed of three independent regions, has been
  put in the middle of `FORK` and `JOIN` states, which will cause the regions to
  go into their initial states and to be joined by their end states.
* From the `JOIN` state, we automatically go into a `CHOICE` state, which checks
  for the existence of error flags in extended state variables. Tasks can set
  these flags, and doing so gives the `CHOICE` state the ability to go into the `ERROR`
  state, where errors can be handled either automatically or manually.
* The `AUTOMATIC` state in `ERROR` can try to automatically fix an error and goes
  back to `READY` if it succeeds. If the error is something what
  cannot be handled automatically, user intervention is needed and the
  machine is put into the `MANUAL` state by the `FALLBACK` event.

The following listing shows the enumeration that defines the possible states:

.States

The following listing shows the enumeration that defines the events:

The following listing configures the possible states:

.Configuration - states

The following listing configures the possible transitions:

The following guard sends a choice entry into the `ERROR` state and needs to
return `TRUE` if an error has happened. This guard checks that
all extended state variables(`T1`, `T2`, and `T3`) are `TRUE`.

The following actions below send events to the state machine to request
the next step, which is either to fall back or to continue back to ready.

Default region execution is synchronous meaning a regions would be processed
sequentially. In this sample we simply want all task regions to get processed
parallel. This can be accomplished by defining `RegionExecutionPolicy`:

The following example shows how this state machine actually works:

====
[source,text]
----
sm>sm start
State machine started
Entry state READY

sm>tasks run
Exit state READY
Entry state TASKS
run task on T2
run task on T1
run task on T3
run task on T2 done
run task on T1 done
run task on T3 done
Entry state T2
Entry state T1
Entry state T3
Exit state T2
Exit state T1
Exit state T3
Entry state T3E
Entry state T1E
Entry state T2E
Exit state TASKS
Entry state READY

In the preceding listing, we can see that tasks run multiple times.
In the next listing, we introduce errors:

====
[source,text]
----
sm>tasks list
Tasks {T1=true, T3=true, T2=true}

sm>tasks fail T1

sm>tasks list
Tasks {T1=false, T3=true, T2=true}

sm>tasks run
Entry state TASKS
run task on T1
run task on T3
run task on T2
run task on T1 done
run task on T3 done
run task on T2 done
Entry state T1
Entry state T3
Entry state T2
Entry state T1E
Entry state T2E
Entry state T3E
Exit state TASKS
Entry state JOIN
Exit state JOIN
Entry state ERROR
Entry state AUTOMATIC
Exit state AUTOMATIC
Exit state ERROR
Entry state READY
----

In the preceding listing, if we simulate a failure for task T1, it is fixed
automatically.
In the next listing, we introduce more errors:

====
[source,text]
----
sm>tasks list
Tasks {T1=true, T3=true, T2=true}

sm>tasks fail T2

sm>tasks run
Entry state TASKS
run task on T2
run task on T1
run task on T3
run task on T2 done
run task on T1 done
run task on T3 done
Entry state T2
Entry state T1
Entry state T3
Entry state T1E
Entry state T2E
Entry state T3E
Exit state TASKS
Entry state JOIN
Exit state JOIN
Entry state ERROR
Entry state AUTOMATIC
Exit state AUTOMATIC
Entry state MANUAL

sm>tasks fix
Exit state MANUAL
Exit state ERROR
Entry state READY
----
====

In the precding example, if we simulate failure for either task `T2` or `T3`, the state
machine goes to the `MANUAL` state, where problem needs to be fixed manually
before it can go back to the `READY` state.
