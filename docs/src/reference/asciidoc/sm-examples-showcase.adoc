== Showcase

Showcase is a complex state machine that shows all possible transition
topologies up to four levels of state nesting.
The following image shows the state machine:

The following listing shows the enumeration that defines the possible states:

====
.States
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/demo/showcase/Application.java[tags=snippetB]
----
====

The following listing shows the enumeration that defines the events:

====
.Events
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/demo/showcase/Application.java[tags=snippetC]
----

The following listing shows the code that configures the state machine:

====
.Configuration - states
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/demo/showcase/Application.java[tags=snippetAA]

The following listing shows the code that configures the state machine's transitions:

====
.Configuration - transitions
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/demo/showcase/Application.java[tags=snippetAB]

The following listing shows the code that configures the state machine's actions and guards:

====
.Configuration - actions and guards
[source,java,indent=0]

The following listing shows how the single action is defined:

====
.Action
[source,java,indent=0]

The following listing shows how the single guard is defined:

====
.Guard
[source,java,indent=0]

The following listing shows the output that this state machine produces when it runs and
various events are sent to it:

====
[source,text]
----
sm>start
Init foo to 0
Entry state S0
Entry state S1
Entry state S11
State machine started

sm>event A
Event A send

sm>sm event C
Exit state S11
Exit state S1
Entry state S2
Entry state S21
Entry state S211
Event C send

sm>event H
Switch foo to 1
Internal transition source=S0
Event H send

sm>event C
Exit state S211
Exit state S21
Exit state S2
Entry state S1
Entry state S11
Event C send

sm>event A
Exit state S11
Exit state S1
Entry state S1
Entry state S11
Event A send
----
====

In the preceding output, we can see that:

* The state machine is started, which takes it to its initial state (`S11`)
  through superstates (`S1`) and (`S0`). Also, the extended state variable, `foo`, is
  initialized to `0`.
* We try to execute a self transition in state `S1` with event `A`, but
  nothing happens because the transition is guarded by variable `foo` to
  be `1`.
* We send event `C`, which takes us to the other state machine, where
  the initial state (`S211`) and its superstates are entered. In there, we
  can use event `H`, which does a simple internal transition to flip the
  `foo` variable. Then we go back by using event `C`.
* Event `A` is sent again, and now `S1` does a self transition because the
  guard evaluates to `true`.

The following example offers a closer look at how hierarchical states and their event
handling works:

====
[source,text]
----
sm>variables
No variables

sm>start
Init foo to 0
Entry state S0
Entry state S1
Entry state S11
State machine started

sm>variables
foo=0

sm>event H
Internal transition source=S1
Event H send

sm>variables
foo=0

sm>event C
Exit state S11
Exit state S1
Entry state S2
Entry state S21
Entry state S211
Event C send

sm>variables
foo=0

sm>event H
Switch foo to 1
Internal transition source=S0
Event H send

sm>variables
foo=1

sm>event H
Switch foo to 0
Internal transition source=S2
Event H send

sm>variables
foo=0
----
====

In the preceding sample:

* We print extended state variables in various stages.
* With event `H`, we end up running an internal transition,
  which is logged with its source state.
* Note how event `H` is handled in
  different states (`S0`, `S1`, and `S2`). This is a good example of how
  hierarchical states and their event handling works. If state `S2` is
  unable to handle event `H` due to a guard condition, its parent is
  checked next. This guarantees that, while the machine is on state `S2`, the `foo` flag
  is always flipped around. However, in state `S1`, event `H` always
  matches to its dummy transition without guard or action, so it never
  happens.
