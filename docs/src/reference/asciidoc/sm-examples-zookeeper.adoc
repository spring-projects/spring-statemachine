[[statemachine-examples-zookeeper]]
== Zookeeper

Zookeeper is a distributed version from the
<<statemachine-examples-turnstile>> sample.

NOTE: This sample needs an external `Zookeeper` instance that is accessible from
`localhost` and has the default port and settings.

Configuration of this sample is almost the same as the `turnstile` sample. We
add only the configuration for the distributed state machine where we
configure `StateMachineEnsemble`, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/demo/zookeeper/Application.java[tags=snippetA]
----
====

The actual `StateMachineEnsemble` needs to be created as a bean, together
with the `CuratorFramework` client, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/demo/zookeeper/Application.java[tags=snippetB]
----
====

For the next example, we need to create two different shell instances.
We need to create one instance, see what happens, and then create the second instance.
The following command starts the shell instances (remember to start only one instance for now):

====
[source,text,subs="attributes"]
----
@n1:~# java -jar spring-statemachine-samples-zookeeper-{revnumber}.jar
----
====


When state machine is started, its initial state is
`LOCKED`. Then it sends a `COIN` event to transition into `UNLOCKED` state.
The following example shows what happens:

====
.Shell1
[source,text]
----
sm>start
Entry state LOCKED
State machine started

sm>event COIN
Exit state LOCKED
Entry state UNLOCKED
Event COIN send

sm>state
UNLOCKED
----
====

Now you can open a second shell instance and start a state machine,
by using the same command that you used to start the first state machine. You should see
that the distributed state (`UNLOCKED`) is entered instead of the default
initial state (`LOCKED`).

The following example shows the state machine and its output:

====
.Shell2
[source,text]
----
sm>start
State machine started

sm>state
UNLOCKED
----
====

Then from either shell (we use second instance in the next example), send a
`PUSH` event to transit from the `UNLOCKED` into the `LOCKED` state.
The following example shows the state machine command and its output:

====
.Shell2
[source,text]
----
sm>event PUSH
Exit state UNLOCKED
Entry state LOCKED
Event PUSH send
----
====

In the other shell (the first shell if you ran the preceding command in the second shell),
you should see the state be changed automatically,
based on distributed state kept in Zookeeper.
The following example shows the state machine command and its output:

====
.Shell1
[source,text]
----
sm>Exit state UNLOCKED
Entry state LOCKED
----
====
