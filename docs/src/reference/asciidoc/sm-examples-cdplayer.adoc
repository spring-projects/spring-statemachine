== CD Player

CD Player is a sample which resembles a use case that many people have
used in the real world. CD Player itself is a really simple entity that allows a
user to open a deck, insert or change a disk, and then drive the player's
functionality by pressing various buttons (`eject`, `play`,
`stop`, `pause`, `rewind`, and `backward`).

How many of us have really given thought to what it will take to
make code that interacts with hardware to drive a CD Player. Yes, the
concept of a player is simple, but, if you look behind the scenes,
things actually get a bit convoluted.

You have probably noticed that, if your deck is open and you press play, the
deck closes and a song starts to play (if a CD was inserted).
In a sense, when the deck is open, you first need to close
it and then try to start playing (again, if a CD is actually inserted). Hopefully,
you have now realized that a simple CD Player is so simple.
Sure, you can wrap all this with a simple class that has a few boolean variables
and probably a few nested if-else clauses. That will do the job, but what
about if you need to make all this behavior much more complex? Do you
really want to keep adding more flags and if-else clauses?

The following image shows the state machine for our simple CD player:

The rest of this section goes through how this sample and its state machine is designed and
how those two interacts with each other. The following three configuration sections
are used within an `EnumStateMachineConfigurerAdapter`.

In the preceding configuration:

* We used `EnumStateMachineConfigurerAdapter` to configure states and
  transitions.
* The `CLOSED` and `OPEN` states are defined as substates of `IDLE`, and
  the `PLAYING` and `PAUSED` states are defined as substates of `BUSY`.
* With the `CLOSED` state, we added an entry action as a bean called
  `closedEntryAction`.
* In the transitions we mostly map events to expected state
  transitions, such as `EJECT` closing and opening a deck and `PLAY`, `STOP`,
  and `PAUSE` doing their natural transitions. For other transitions, we did the following:
** For source state `PLAYING`, we added a timer trigger, which is
needed to automatically track elapsed time within a playing track and
to have a facility for making the decision about when to switch the to next track.
** For the `PLAY` event, if the source state is `IDLE` and the target state is
  `BUSY`, we defined an action called `playAction` and a guard called `playGuard`.
** For the `LOAD` event and the `OPEN` state, we defined an internal
transition with an action called `loadAction`, which tracks inserting a disc with
extended-state variables.
** The `PLAYING` state defines three internal transitions. One is
triggered by a timer that runs an action called `playingAction`, which updates
the extended state variables. The other two transitions use `trackAction`
with different events (`BACK` and `FORWARD`, respectively) to handle
when the user wants to go back or forward in tracks.

This machine has only have six states, which are defined by the following enumeration:

====
[source,java,indent=0]

include::samples/demo/cdplayer/Application.java[tags=snippetB]

Events represent the buttons the user can
press and whether the user loads a disc into the player.
The following enumeration defines the events:

====

The `cdPlayer` and `library` beans are used to drive the application.
The following listing shows the definition of these two beans:

We define extended state variable keys as simple enumerations,
as the following listing shows:

We wanted to make this sample type safe, so we define our own
annotation (`@StatesOnTransition`), which has a mandatory meta
annotation (`@OnTransition`).
The following listing defines the `@StatesOnTransition` annotation:

`ClosedEntryAction` is an entry action for the `CLOSED` state, to
send a `PLAY` event to the state machine if a disc is present.
The following listing defines `ClosedEntryAction`:

====

include::samples/demo/cdplayer/Application.java[tags=snippetG]

`LoadAction` update an extended state variable if event
headers contain information about a disc to load.
The following listing defines `LoadAction`:

include::samples/demo/cdplayer/Application.java[tags=snippetH]

`PlayAction` resets the player's elapsed time, which is kept as
an extended state variable.
The following listing defines `PlayAction`:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/demo/cdplayer/Application.java[tags=snippetI]
----

`PlayGuard` guards the transition from `IDLE` to `BUSY` with the
`PLAY` event if the `CD` extended state variable does not indicate that a
disc has been loaded.
The following listing defines `PlayGuard`:

====
[source,java,indent=0]

include::samples/demo/cdplayer/Application.java[tags=snippetJ]

`PlayingAction` updates an extended state variable called `ELAPSEDTIME`, which
the player can use to read and update its LCD status display. `PlayingAction` also handles
track shifting when the user goe back or forward in tracks.
The following example defines `PlayingAction`:

====
[source,java,indent=0]

include::samples/demo/cdplayer/Application.java[tags=snippetK]

====

`TrackAction` handles track shift actions when the user goes back or forward
in tracks. If a track is the last on a disc, playing is stopped and the `STOP`
event is sent to a state machine.
The following example defines `TrackAction`:

====

include::samples/demo/cdplayer/Application.java[tags=snippetL]

One other important aspect of state machines is that they have their
own responsibilities (mostly around handling states) and that all application
level logic should be kept outside. This means that applications need
to have a ways to interact with a state machine. Also, note
that we annotated `CdPlayer` with `@WithStateMachine`, which instructs a
state machine to find methods from your POJO, which are then called
with various transitions.
The following example shows how it updates its LCD status display:

====

In the preceding example, we use the `@OnTransition` annotation to hook a callback
when a transition happens with a target state of `BUSY`.

The following listing shows how our state machine handles whether the player is closed:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/demo/cdplayer/CdPlayer.java[tags=snippetB]
----
====

`@OnTransition` (which we used in the preceding examples) can only be
used with strings that are matched from enumerations. `@StatesOnTransition`
lets you create your own type-safe annotations that use real enumerations.

The following example shows how this state machine actually works.

In the preceding run:

* The state machine is started, which causes the machine to be initialized.
* The CD player's LCD screen status is printed.
* The CD library is printed.
* The CD player's deck is opened.
* The CD with index 0 is loaded into a deck.
* Play causes the deck to get closed and immediate play, because a disc
  was inserted.
* We print the LCD status and request the next track.
* We stop playing.
