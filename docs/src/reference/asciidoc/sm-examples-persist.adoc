== Persist

Persist is a sample that uses the <<statemachine-recipes-persist>> recipe to
demonstrate how database entry update logic can be controlled by a
state machine.

The following image shows the state machine logic and configuration:

The following listing shows the state machine configuration:

====
.StateMachine Config
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/demo/persist/Application.java[tags=snippetA]
----
====

The following configuration creates `PersistStateMachineHandler`:

====
.Handler Config
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/demo/persist/Application.java[tags=snippetB]
----
====

The following listing shows the `Order` class used with this sample:

====
.Order Class
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/demo/persist/Application.java[tags=snippetC]
----
====

The following example shows the state machine's output:

====
[source,text]
----
sm>list
Order [id=1, state=PLACED]
Order [id=2, state=PROCESSING]
Order [id=3, state=SENT]
Order [id=4, state=DELIVERED]

sm>process 1
Exit state PLACED
Entry state PROCESSING

sm>list
Order [id=2, state=PROCESSING]
Order [id=3, state=SENT]
Order [id=4, state=DELIVERED]
Order [id=1, state=PROCESSING]

sm>deliver 3
Exit state SENT
Entry state DELIVERED

sm>list
Order [id=2, state=PROCESSING]
Order [id=4, state=DELIVERED]
Order [id=1, state=PROCESSING]
Order [id=3, state=DELIVERED]
----
====

In the preceding run, the state machine:

* Listed rows from an existing embedded database, which is already
  populated with sample data.
* Requested to update order `1` into the `PROCESSING` state.
* List database entries again and see that the state has been changed from
  `PLACED` to `PROCESSING`.
* Update order `3` to update its state from `SENT` to
  `DELIVERED`.

[NOTE]
====
You may wonder where the database is, because there are literally no
signs of it in the sample code. The sample is based on Spring Boot and,
because the necessary classes are in a classpath, an embedded `HSQL` instance
is created automatically.

Spring Boot even creates an instance of `JdbcTemplate`, which you
can autowire, as we did in `Persist.java`, shown in the following listing:

=====
[source,java,indent=0]

Next, we need to handle state changes. The following listing shows how we do so:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/demo/persist/Persist.java[tags=snippetB]
----

Finally, we use a `PersistStateChangeListener` to update the database, as the
following listing shows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
