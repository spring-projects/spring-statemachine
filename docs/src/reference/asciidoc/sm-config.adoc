== Statemachine Configuration

One of the common tasks when using a state machine is to design its
runtime configuration. This chapter focuses on how Spring
Statemachine is configured and how it leverages Spring's lightweight
IoC containers to simplify the application internals to make it more
manageable.

NOTE: Configuration examples in this section are not feature complete. That is,
you always need to have definitions of both states and transitions.
Otherwise, state machine configuration would be ill-formed. We have
simply made code snippets less verbose by leaving other needed parts
out.

[[statemachine-config-annotations]]
=== Using `enable` Annotations

We use two familiar Spring _enabler_ annotations to ease configuration:
`@EnableStateMachine` and `@EnableStateMachineFactory`.
These annotations, when placed in a `@Configuration` class, enable
some basic functionality needed by a state machine.

You can use `@EnableStateMachine` when you need a configuration to create an
instance of `StateMachine`. Usually, a `@Configuration` class extends adapters
(`EnumStateMachineConfigurerAdapter` or `StateMachineConfigurerAdapter`), which
lets you override configuration callback methods. We automatically
detect whether you use these adapter classes and modify the runtime configuration
logic accordingly.

You can use `@EnableStateMachineFactory` when you need a configuration to create an
instance of a `StateMachineFactory`.

NOTE: Usage examples of these are shown in below sections.

[[statemachine-config-states]]
=== Configuring States

We get into more complex configuration examples a bit later in this guide, but
we first start with something simple. For most simple state
machine, you can use `EnumStateMachineConfigurerAdapter` and define
possible states and choose the initial and optional end states.

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetAA]
----
====

You can also use strings instead of enumerations as states and
events by using `StateMachineConfigurerAdapter`, as shown in the next example. Most
of the configuration examples use enumerations, but, generally speaking,
you can interchange strings and enumerations.

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetAB]
----
====

NOTE: Using enumerations brings a safer set of states and event types but
limits possible combinations to compile time. Strings do not have this
limitation and let you use more dynamic ways to build state
machine configurations but do not allow same level of safety.

=== Configuring Hierarchical States

You can define hierarchical states can by using multiple `withStates()`
calls, where you can use `parent()` to indicate that these
particular states are sub-states of some other state.
The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetB]
----
====

=== Configuring Regions

There are no special configuration methods to mark a collection of
states to be part of an orthogonal state. To put it simply, orthogonal
state is created when the same hierarchical state machine has multiple sets
of states, each of which has an initial state. Because an individual state
machine can only have one initial state, multiple initial states must
mean that a specific state must have multiple independent regions.
The following example shows how to define regions:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetP]
----
====

When persisting machines with regions or generally
relying on any functionalities to reset a machine, you may need
to have a dedicated ID for a region. By default, this ID
is a generated UUID. As the following example shows, `StateConfigurer` has
a method called `region(String id)` that lets you set the ID for a region:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetPP]
----
====

=== Configuring Transitions

We support three different types of transitions: `external`,
`internal`, and `local`. Transitions are triggered either by a signal
(which is an event sent into a state machine) or by a timer.
The following example shows how to define all three kinds of transitions:
====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetC]
----
====

=== Configuring Guards

You can use guards to protect state transitions. You can use the `Guard` interface
to do an evaluation where a method has access to a `StateContext`.
The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetD]
----
====

In the preceding example, we used two different types of guard configurations. First, we
created a simple `Guard` as a bean and attached it to the transition between
states `S1` and `S2`.

Second, we used a SPeL expression as a guard to dicate that the
expression must return a `BOOLEAN` value. Behind the scenes, this
expression-based guard is a `SpelExpressionGuard`. We attached it to
the transition between states `S2` and `S3`. Both guards
always evaluate to `true`.

[[statemachine-config-actions]]
=== Configuring Actions

You can define actions to be executed with transitions and states.
An action is always run as a result of a transition that
originates from a trigger. The following example shows how to define an action:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetEA]
----
====

In the preceding example, a single `Action` is defined as a bean named `action` and associated
with a transition from `S1` to `S2`.
The following example shows how to use an action multiple times:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetEB]
----
====

NOTE: Usually, you would not define the same `Action` instance for different
stages, but we did it here to not make too much noise in a code
snippet.

In the preceding example, a single `Action` is defined by the bean named `action` and associated
with states `S1`, `S2`, and `S3`. We need to clarify what is going on here:

* We defined an action for the initial state, `S1`.
* We defined an entry action for state `S1` and left the exit action empty.
* We defined an exit action for state `S2` and left the entry action empty.
* We defined a single state action for state `S2`.
* We defined both entry and exit actions for state `S3`.
* Note that state `S1` is used twice with `initial()` and `state()`
  functions. You need to do this only if you want to define entry or exit
  actions with initial state.

IMPORTANT: Defining action with `initial()` function only runs a particular
action when a state machine or sub state is started. This action
is an initializing action that is run only once. An action defined
with `state()` is then run if the state machine transitions back
and forward between initial and non-initial states.

==== State Actions

State actions are run differently compared to entry and exit
actions, because execution happens after state has been entered
and can be cancelled if state exit happens before a particular action
has been completed.

State actions are executed using normal reactive flow by subscribing with
a Reactor's default parallel scheduler. This means that, whatever you do in your
action, you need to be able to catch `InterruptedException` or, more generally,
periodically check whether `Thread` is interrupted.

The following example shows typical configuration that uses default the `IMMEDIATE_CANCEL`, which
would immediately cancel a running task when its state is complete:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests11.java[tags=snippetA]
----
====

You can set a policy to `TIMEOUT_CANCEL` together with a global timeout
for each machine. This changes state behavior to await action completion
before cancelation is requested. The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests11.java[tags=snippetB]
----
====

If `Event` directly takes a machine into a state so that event headers
are available to a particular action, you can also use a dedicated
event header to set a specific timeout (defined in `millis`).
You can use the reserved header value `StateMachineMessageHeaders.HEADER_DO_ACTION_TIMEOUT`
for this purpose. The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests11.java[tags=snippetC]
----
====

[[statemachine-config-transition-actions-errorhandling]]
==== Transition Action Error Handling

You can always catch exceptions manually. However, with actions defined for
transitions, you can define an error action that is called if an
exception is raised. The exception is then available from a `StateContext`
passed to that action. The following example shows how to create a state
that handles an exception:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetEC]
----
====

If need be, you can manually create similar logic for every action.
The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetED]
----
====

[[statemachine-config-state-actions-errorhandling]]
==== State Action Error Handling

Logic similar to the logic that handles errors in state transitions is also available
for entry to a state and exit from a state.

For these situations, `StateConfigurer` has methods called `stateEntry`, `stateDo`, and
`stateExit`. These methods define an `error` action together with a normal (non-error) `action`.
The following example shows how to use all three methods:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetEE]
----
====

=== Configuring Pseudo States

_Pseudo state_ configuration is usually done by configuring states and
transitions. Pseudo states are automatically added to state machine as
states.

==== Initial State

You can mark a particular state as initial state by using the `initial()`
method. This initial action is good, for example, to initialize
extended state variables. The following example shows how to use the `initial()` method:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetQ]
----
====

==== Terminate State

You can mark a particular state as being an end state by using the `end()` method.
You can do so at most once for each individual sub-machine or region.
The following example shows how to use the `end()` method:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetAA]
----
====

==== State History

You can define state history once for each individual state machine.
You need to choose its state identifier and set either `History.SHALLOW` or
`History.DEEP`. The following example uses `History.SHALLOW`:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetR]
----
====

Also, as the preceding example shows, you can optionally define a default
transition from a history state into a state vertex in a same machine.
This transition takes place as a default if, for example, the machine has
never been entered -- thus, no history would be available. If a default
state transition is not defined, then normal entry into a region is
done. This default transition is also used if a machine's history is
a final state.

==== Choice State

Choice needs to be defined in both states and transitions to work
properly. You can mark a particular state as being a choice state by using the `choice()`
method. This state needs to match source state when a transition is
configured for this choice.

You can configure a transition by using `withChoice()`, where you define source
state and a `first/then/last` structure, which is equivalent to a normal
`if/elseif/else`. With `first` and `then`, you can specify a guard just
as you would use a condition with `if/elseif` clauses.

A transition needs to be able to exist, so you must make sure to use `last`.
Otherwise, the configuration is ill-formed. The following example shows how to define
a choice state:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetS]
----
====

Actions can be run with both incoming and outgoing transitions of
a choice pseudostate. As the following example shows, one dummy lambda
action is defined that leads into a choice state and one similar dummy
lambda action is defined for one outgoing transition (where it also
defines an error action):

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetSSS]
----
====

NOTE: Junction have same api format meaning actions can be defined
similarly.

[[statemachine-config-states-junction]]
==== Junction State

You need to define a junction in both states and transitions for it to work
properly. You can mark a particular state as being a choice state by using the `junction()`
method. This state needs to match the source state when a transition is
configured for this choice.

You can configure the transition by using `withJunction()` where you define source
state and a `first/then/last` structure (which is equivalent to a normal
`if/elseif/else`). With `first` and `then`, you can specify a guard as
you would use a condition with `if/elseif` clauses.

A transition needs to be able to exist, so you must make sure to use `last`.
Otherwise, the configuration is ill-formed.
The following example uses a junction:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetSS]
----
====

NOTE: The difference between choice and junction is purely academic, as both are
implemented with `first/then/last` structures . However, in theory, based
on UML modeling, `choice` allows only one incoming transition while
`junction` allows multiple incoming transitions. At a code level, the
functionality is pretty much identical.

==== Fork State

You must define a fork in both states and transitions for it to work
properly. You can mark a particular state as being a choice state by using the `fork()`
method. This state needs to match source state when a transition is
configured for this fork.

The target state needs to be a super state or an immediate state in a
regions. Using a super state as a target takes all regions into
initial states. Targeting individual state gives more controlled entry
into regions. The following example uses a fork:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetT]
----
====

==== Join State

You must define a join in both states and transitions for it to work
properly. You can mark aparticular state as being a choice state by using the `join()`
method. This state does not need to match either source states or a
target state in a transition configuration.

You can select a target state where a transition goes when all source states
have been joined. If you use state hosting regions as the source, the end
states of a region are used as joins. Otherwise, you can pick any
states from a region. The following exmaple uses a join:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetU]
----
====

You can also have multiple transitions originate from a
join state. It this case, we advise you to use guards and define your guards
such that only one guard evaluates to `TRUE` at any given time. Otherwise,
transition behavior is not predictable. This is shown in the following example, where the guard
checks whether the extended state has variables:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetUUU]
----
====

[[statemachine-config-states-exitentry]]
==== Exit and Entry Point States

You can use exit and entry points to do more controlled exit and entry
from and into a submachine.
The following example uses the `withEntry` and `withExit` methods to define entry points:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetUU]
----
====

As shown in the preceding, you need to mark particular states as being `exit` and
`entry` states. Then you create a normal transitions into those states
and also specify `withExit()` and `withEntry()`, where those states
exit and entry respectively.

[[statemachine-config-commonsettings]]
=== Configuring Common Settings

You can set part of a common state machine configuration by using
`ConfigurationConfigurer`. With it you can set `BeanFactory` and an autostart flag
for a state machine. It also lets you register `StateMachineListener` instances,
configure transition conflict policy and region execution policy.
The following example shows how to use `ConfigurationConfigurer`:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetYA]
----
====

By default, the state machine `autoStartup` flag is disabled, because all
instances that handle sub-states are controlled by the state machine itself
and cannot be automatically started. Also, it is much safer to leave
whether a machine should be started
automatically or not to the user. This flag controls only the autostart of a
top-level state machine.

Setting `machineId` within a configuration class is simply a convenience for those times when
you want or need to do it there.

Registering `StateMachineListener` instances is also partly for
convenience but is required if you want to catch a callback during a
state machine lifecycle, such as getting notified of a state machine's
start and stop events. Note that you cannot listen a state
machine's start events if `autoStartup` is enabled, unless you register a listener
during a configuration phase.

You can use `transitionConflictPolicy` when multiple
transition paths could be selected. One usual use case for this is when a
machine contains anonymous transitions that lead out from a sub-state
and a parent state and you want to define a policy in which one is
selected. This is a global setting within a machine instance and
defaults to `CHILD`.

You can use `withDistributed()` to configure `DistributedStateMachine`. It
lets you set a `StateMachineEnsemble`, which (if it exists) automatically
wraps any created `StateMachine` with `DistributedStateMachine` and
enables distributed mode. The following example shows how to use it:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetYB]
----
====

For more about distributed states, see <<sm-distributed>>.

The `StateMachineModelVerifier` interface is used internally to
do some sanity checks for a state machine's structure. Its purpose is to
fail fast early instead of letting common configuration errors into a
state machine. By default, a verifier is automatically enabled and the
`DefaultStateMachineModelVerifier` implementation is used.

With `withVerifier()`, you can disable verifier or set a custom one if
needed. The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests.java[tags=snippetYC]
----
====

For more about config model, see <<devdocs-configmodel>>.

NOTE: The `withSecurity`, `withMonitoring` and `withPersistence` configuration methods
are documented in <<sm-security>>, <<sm-monitoring>>, and
<<sm-persist-statemachineruntimepersister>>, respectively.

=== Configuring Model

`StateMachineModelFactory` is a hook that lets you configure a statemachine model
without using a manual configuration. Essentially, it is a third-party
integration to integrate into a configuration model.
You can hook `StateMachineModelFactory` into a configuration model by
using a `StateMachineModelConfigurer`. The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests8.java[tags=snippetA]
----
====

The follwoing example uses `CustomStateMachineModelFactory` to
define two states (`S1` and `S2`) and an event (`E1`) between those
states:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::samples/DocsConfigurationSampleTests8.java[tags=snippetB]
----
====

NOTE: Defining a custom model is usually not what people are looking for,
although it is possible. However, it is a central concept of allowing
external access to this configuration model.

You can find an example of using this model factory integration in
<<sm-papyrus>>. You can find more generic info about custom model integration
in <<devdocs>>.

[[statemachine-config-thingstoremember]]
=== Things to Remember

When defining actions, guards, or any other references from a
configuration, it pays to remember how Spring Framework works
with beans. In the next example, we have defined a normal configuration with
states `S1` and `S2` and four transitions between those. All transitions
are guarded by either `guard1` or `guard2`. You must ensure that
`guard1` is created as a real bean because it is annotated with
`@Bean`, while `guard2` is not.

This means that event `E3` would get the `guard2` condition as
`TRUE`, and `E4` would get the `guard2` condition as `FALSE`, because those are
coming from plain method calls to those functions.

However, because `guard1` is defined as a `@Bean`, it is proxied by the
Spring Framework. Thus, additional calls to its method result in
only one instantiation of that instance. Event `E1` would first get the
proxied instance with condition `TRUE`, while event `E2` would get the same
instance with `TRUE` condition when the method call was defined with
`FALSE`. This is not a Spring State Machine-specific behavior. Rather, it is
how Spring Framework works with beans.
The following example shows how this arrangement works:

====
