== Turnstile

Turnstile is a simple device that gives you access if payment is
made. It is a concept that is simple to model using a state machine. In its
simplest form, there are only two states: `LOCKED` and `UNLOCKED`. Two
events, `COIN` and `PUSH` can happen, depending on whether someone
makes a payment or tries to go through the turnstile.
The following image shows the state machine:

The following listing shows the enumeration that defines the possible states:

The following listing shows the enumeration that defines the events:

.Events
[source,java,indent=0]

The following listing shows the code that configures the state machine:

You can see how this sample state machine interacts with events by
running the `turnstile` sample. The following listing shows how to do so
and shows the command's output:
